- set up files via gem bundle <enter name>

- create scraper (require nokogiri, open-uri)
- clean output

to do:

Make sure to create a good README.md with a short description, install instructions, a contributors guide and a link to the license for your code.
Make sure to check each box in your spec.md (replace the space between the square braces with an x) and explain next to each one how you've met the requirement before you submit your project.
Prepare a video demo (narration helps!) describing how a user would interact with your working gem.
Write a blog post about the project and process.
On Learn, submit links to the GitHub repository for your app, your video demo, and your blog post each to the corresponding textbox in the right rail, and hit "I'm done" to wrap it up.
